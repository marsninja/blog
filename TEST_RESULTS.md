# Test Results - Jac Blog Setup

## Test Summary

All tests **PASSED** successfully! The Jac blog setup is fully functional.

---

## Test Details

### 1. Dependency Installation ✓

**Test:** Install all required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- All dependencies already satisfied or installed successfully
- Jac syntax highlighter package installed as `jac-blog-syntax==1.0.0`

---

### 2. Jac Syntax Highlighting Registration ✓

**Test:** Verify Jac lexer is registered with Pygments
```bash
python3 -c "from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name;
            lexer = get_lexer_by_name('jac');
            print(f'Jac lexer loaded: {lexer.name}')"
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
```
Jac lexer loaded: Jac
```

The custom Pygments lexer is properly registered and functional.

### 3. MkDocs Build Process ✓

**Test:** Build the static site
```bash
cd ~/blog && mkdocs build
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
```
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
INFO    -  Building documentation to directory: /home/ninja/blog/site
INFO    -  Documentation built in 0.21 seconds
Running pre-build hook...
Creating jaclang zip...
Zip saved to: docs/playground/jaclang.zip
Jaclang zip file created successfully.
```

**Verified:**
- Site builds without errors
- Build hook creates jaclang.zip (5.8MB) successfully
- All JavaScript files copied to site/js/
- All pages generated correctly

---

### 4. Syntax Highlighting in Generated HTML ✓

**Test:** Verify Jac syntax highlighting is applied in generated HTML

**Result:** SUCCESS

Generated HTML contains:
- `language-jac` class on code blocks
- Proper syntax highlighting with span elements:
  - `<span class="k">` for keywords (with, entry, for)
  - `<span class="nb">` for built-in functions (print, range)
  - `<span class="s2">` for strings
  - `<span class="sa">` for f-string prefix
  - `<span class="si">` for f-string interpolation
  - Line numbers and anchors for code navigation

Example from generated HTML:
```html
<div class="language-jac highlight">
  <span class="k">with</span> <span class="k">entry</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello from Jac!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
```

### 5. Development Server Startup ✓

**Test:** Start the custom development server with CORS headers
```bash
cd ~/blog && python scripts/mkdocs_serve.py
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
```
INFO:     Started server process [13218]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**Verified:**
- Server starts successfully on port 8000
- CORS headers configured for SharedArrayBuffer support
- Auto-rebuild functionality working
- Clean shutdown process

---

### 6. File Structure Verification ✓

**Test:** Verify all necessary files are present and in correct locations

**Result:** SUCCESS

**Source Files:**
- ✓ mkdocs.yml - MkDocs configuration
- ✓ jac_syntax_highlighter.py - Pygments lexer
- ✓ docs/js/jac.monarch.js - Monaco lexer
- ✓ docs/js/run-code.js - Code execution engine
- ✓ docs/js/pyodide-worker.js - Web worker
- ✓ docs/playground/language-configuration.json - Language config
- ✓ docs/extra.css - Custom styling
- ✓ scripts/handle_jac_compile_data.py - Build hook
- ✓ scripts/mkdocs_serve.py - Custom dev server

**Built Files:**
- ✓ site/js/jac.monarch.js (4.2 KB)
- ✓ site/js/pyodide-worker.js (3.4 KB)
- ✓ site/js/run-code.js (15 KB)
- ✓ site/posts/welcome/ - Generated post
- ✓ docs/playground/jaclang.zip (5.8 MB)

## Fixes Applied During Testing

### Issue 1: Missing overrides directory
**Problem:** Build failed with "custom_dir does not exist"
**Solution:** Removed `custom_dir: overrides` from mkdocs.yml (not needed for basic setup)

### Issue 2: Build hook path dependency
**Problem:** Hook expected relative path `../jac/jaclang` which doesn't work in standalone setup
**Solution:** Modified hook to auto-detect installed jaclang package location:
```python
import jaclang
TARGET_FOLDER = os.path.dirname(jaclang.__file__)
```

### Issue 3: Hook dependencies
**Problem:** Hook imported unnecessary utilities and had unused functions
**Solution:** Simplified to only include essential playground zip creation

## Browser Testing Recommendations

While server-side functionality is fully tested, browser-based features require manual verification:

1. **Open in browser:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. **Test syntax highlighting:** Verify colors in code blocks
3. **Test interactive execution:** Click "Run" buttons
4. **Test code editing:** Modify code in Monaco Editor
5. **Test input handling:** If code prompts for input
6. **Test mobile responsiveness:** Check on different screen sizes
