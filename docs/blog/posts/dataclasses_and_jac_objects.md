# Dataclasses: Python's Admission That Classes Are Broken (And How Jac Fixes It Properly)

Python's traditional class syntax has a problem: defining any class with fields requires excessive boilerplate. After decades of developers writing the same `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` methods, Python 3.7 introduced dataclasses ([PEP 557](https://peps.python.org/pep-0557/)) as a decorator-based solution. But dataclasses are a retrofit—what if dataclass semantics were built into the language from the start?

Jac explores this question by providing two archetype keywords: `class` for traditional Python semantics and `obj` for dataclass-style semantics as a first-class language feature.

## The Boilerplate Problem

Here's a simple Python class with three fields:

<div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, email: str):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.email = email

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person(name={self.name!r}, age={self.age!r}, email={self.email!r})"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Person):
            return False
        return (self.name == other.name and
                self.age == other.age and
                self.email == other.email)

print(Person(name="Alice", age=30, email="alice@example.com"))
```
</div>

We wrote each field name **nine times**. Add a fourth field? Update three methods. Forget one? Silent bugs. This violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) at a fundamental level.

PEP 557 identifies this exact problem, noting that before dataclasses, developers relied on `collections.namedtuple`, `typing.NamedTuple`, or third-party libraries like `attrs`, each with limitations. The PEP argues that *"with the addition of PEP 526, Python has a concise way to specify the type of class members,"* making it possible to automatically generate boilerplate methods from type-annotated class variables.

## Python's Solution: Dataclasses

Python 3.7 introduced the `@dataclass` decorator to generate boilerplate:

<div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Automatically generates: __init__, __repr__, __eq__
@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str

print(Person(name="Alice", age=30, email="alice@example.com"))
```
</div>

From 15+ lines to 4 lines. The field definitions become the single source of truth. Dataclasses can be thought of as *"mutable namedtuples with defaults"* (PEP 557).

### Dataclass Features

Dataclasses support defaults, immutability (`frozen=True`), ordering (`order=True`), and post-initialization:

<div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Product:
    name: str
    price: float
    quantity: int = 0
    total_value: float = field(init=False)

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.total_value = self.price * self.quantity

    def restock(self, amount: int):
        self.quantity += amount
        self.total_value = self.price * self.quantity


print(Product(name="Widget", price=9.99, quantity=10).total_value)
```
</div>

This works well, but several limitations emerge from the decorator-based approach:

1. **Runtime Transformation** - The decorator transforms the class at definition time, complicating static analysis
2. **Mutable Default Trap** - Must use `field(default_factory=list)` for mutable defaults; `items: list = []` would be shared across instances
3. **Limited Validation** - No built-in field validation; PEP 557 explicitly scopes dataclasses as *"a code generator for these methods based on annotations,"* not a validation framework
4. **Mixing Generated and Manual Code** - Overriding one method while keeping others auto-generated increases cognitive overhead

PEP 557 explicitly states that dataclasses should *"not interfere with any usage of the class"*—they remain "truly normal Python classes." This constraint reflects Python's need for backward compatibility.

## Jac's Design-First Approach

Rather than retrofitting dataclass semantics onto traditional classes, Jac provides two distinct archetype keywords:

| Archetype | Semantics | Self Parameter | Field Behavior | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **`class`** | Traditional Python | Explicit with type annotation | `has` fields with defaults become class variables | Class variables or traditional behavior needed |
| **`obj`** | Dataclass built-in | Implicit (available in body) | All `has` fields are instance variables | Common case where classes have fields |

Here's the same `Person` in Jac:

<div class="code-block">
```jac
obj Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
    has email: str;
}

with entry {
    print(Person(name="Alice", age=30, email="alice@example.com"));
}
```
</div>

No decorator, no import, just clean declaration. The `obj` keyword signals dataclass semantics as a language-level construct.

### Key Differences from Python

<div class="code-block">
```jac
obj Counter {
    has count: int = 0;

    def increment {  # No self parameter in signature
        self.count += 1;  # But self is available in body
    }

    def get_count -> int {
        return self.count;
    }
}

with entry {
    c1 = Counter();
    c1.increment();
    c1.increment();

    c2 = Counter();
    c2.increment();

    print(f"c1: {c1.get_count()}, c2: {c2.get_count()}");
    # c1: 2, c2: 1
}
```
</div>

Each instance maintains independent state—`c1` and `c2` don't interfere because `obj` fields are instance variables by default.

??? note "Jac's optional () syntax sugar"
    Jac makes empty parentheses `()` optional in function/method declarations—`def increment` works the same as `def increment()`. Additionally, the return type annotation defaults to `-> None` if not specified, which is particularly clean for functions that don't return values. You can write `def increment { ... }` instead of `def increment() -> None { ... }`.

### The `Product` Example in Jac

<div class="code-block">
```jac
obj Product {
    has name: str;
    has price: float;
    has quantity: int = 0;
    has total_value: float by postinit;  # Computed field

    def postinit {
        self.total_value = self.price * self.quantity;
    }

    def restock(amount: int) {
        self.quantity += amount;
        self.total_value = self.price * self.quantity;
    }
}

with entry {
    product = Product(name="Widget", price=9.99, quantity=10);
    print(f"{product.name}: ${product.total_value:.2f}");
    # Widget: $99.90

    product.restock(5);
    print(f"After restock: {product.quantity} units, ${product.total_value:.2f}");
    # After restock: 15 units, $149.85
}
```
</div>

Compare to the Python version:
- No decorator import
- `by postinit` is cleaner than `field(init=False)`
- No explicit `self` in method signatures
- Same functionality, less ceremony

### Static Members and Access Control

<div class="code-block">
```jac
obj BankAccount {
    has account_number: str;
    has :priv balance: float = 0.0;  # Private field

    static has total_accounts: int = 0;  # Class-level state

    def postinit {
        BankAccount.total_accounts += 1;
    }

    static def get_total -> int {
        return BankAccount.total_accounts;
    }

    def deposit(amount: float) {
        self.balance += amount;
    }
}

with entry {
    acc1 = BankAccount(account_number="A001");
    acc2 = BankAccount(account_number="A002");

    print(f"Total accounts: {BankAccount.get_total()}");
    # Total accounts: 2
}
```
</div>

The `static has` keyword makes class-level state explicit, and `:priv` provides access control as a language feature rather than convention.

## Why This Matters

Dataclasses introduced in python 3.7 aren't just a convenience—they represent **fundamentally better class design**. The traditional Python class syntax with manual `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` methods was always a design flaw, not a feature. Writing the same field name nine times isn't "explicit is better than implicit"—it's error-prone busywork.

The proof is in adoption: dataclasses have become the default recommendation for new Python code. They're not just for "simple data containers"—they're better for virtually any class with fields. The boilerplate generation isn't sacrificing anything; it's eliminating redundancy while maintaining full class functionality.

**The question becomes**: If dataclasses are fundamentally better, why are they a decorator rather than the default?

The answer is Python's evolutionary constraint. With millions of lines of existing code using traditional classes, Python couldn't change the default behavior of the `class` keyword. Decorators were the pragmatic path to introduce better semantics without breaking existing code.

**Jac's advantage** is starting fresh. Without legacy constraints, `obj` makes dataclass-style semantics the natural way to define classes with fields:

- **No decorator ceremony** - The better approach is built-in, not opt-in
- **Cleaner syntax** - Implicit `self`, `by postinit` instead of `field(init=False)`
- **Explicit intent** - `static has` distinguishes class variables from the instance variable default
- **Language-level features** - Access modifiers and instance variables as first-class concepts

If Python could redesign classes from scratch today, they'd likely look a lot more like Jac's `obj` than the current `class` syntax. Jac explores what becomes possible when you build the better design into the language from day one.

## Comparison

| Aspect | Python `@dataclass` | Jac `obj` |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Syntax | Decorator on `class` | `obj` keyword |
| Self parameter | Explicit in methods | Implicit in methods |
| Mutable defaults | `field(default_factory=list)` | `has items: list = []` works safely |
| Post-init | `field(init=False)` + `__post_init__` | `by postinit` + `postinit` |
| Static members | `class_var: ClassVar[int]` | `static has count: int` |
| Access control | Convention (`_private`) | Language feature (`:priv`) |
