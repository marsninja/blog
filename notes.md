This document should be used to understand how to write blogs.
* jac and python codeblocks that are inside of the div with the class "code-block" become runnable codeblocks with run button below the code.
* if "run-dot" is added to the class list, the codeblock will have an additional "graph" button to allow users to see the graph attached to root in the doc. That's based on the "jac dot [filename.jac]" command. These should be added to example intended to have an OSP graph.
* Code examples that are intended to be run, should alwayys produce output and code examples intended to have a graph should always connect the graph to root. 
* If the code block is not intended to be runnable it should not be in the div. 
* You can learn the jac language by reading relevant .jac and .md files in /home/ninja/jaseci/jac/examples/reference/, these can also be run with the jac run command to see output for further understanding of the examples. 
* The tone of blog articles should be targeting professional developers.
* There shouldnt be over usage of bulleted lists, though ok when really suitable, tables, and mermaid diagrams should also be used in blogs
